# Statement

Given two strings, s and t, find the minimum window substring in s, which has the following properties:

- It is the shortest substring of s that includes all of the characters present in t.
- It must contain at least the same frequency of each character as in t.
- The order of the characters does not matter here.

Note: If there are multiple valid minimum window substrings, return any one of them.

# Constraints:

- Strings `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English characters.
- 1 <= `s.length`, `t.length` <= 10 ^ 3
