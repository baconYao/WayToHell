# Statement

Given an integer list, nums, find the maximum values in all the contiguous subarrays (windows) of size w.

Note: If the window size is greater than the array size, we consider the entire array as a single window.

# Constraints:

- 1 <= `arr.length` <= 10 ^ 3
- -10 ^ 4 <= `arr[i]` <= 10 ^ 4
- 1 <= `w`
