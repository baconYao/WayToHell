# Statement

Given an unsorted array of positive numbers, `nums`, such that the values lie in the range [1,n]
, inclusive, and that there are n+1 numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in `nums`. There is only one repeated number in `nums`.

Note: You `cannot` modify the given array nums. You have to solve the problem using only constant extra space.

# Constraints:

- 1 <= `n` <= 10^3
- `nums.length` = n + 1
- 1 <= `nums[i]` <= n
- All the integers in `nums` are unique, except for one integer that will appear more than once.
